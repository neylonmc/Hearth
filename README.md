## User Story

The average person takes 23 minutes to find something to watch on Netflix and over 7 minutes picking out their next movie. With more time to watch, read and listen than ever before, we have developed an app that allows users to skip the long review threads and answer the question "What's next?" more quickly.

```
AS an individual, I would like to find something to watch, read or listen.
I WANT to be able to make a decision quickly.
AND find a topic with good reviews/ratings.
SO I find something to stream or read in a timely manner.

```

```

## Future Developments

### More Topics

**Allow users to be able to search and review more topics**

Building a larger community through hearth is our ultimate goal. Allowing users to find more topics such as crafts, kid friendly activities, or fun outdoor parks would be ideal. This way, hearth could reach a larger audience and have topics for everyone.

### Where To Stream Or Buy

**Allow users to be able to see where they can stream shows, music or buy a book**

Browsing reviews is an easy way to find something to keep yourself entertained quickly. But do you have that streaming service or is it on Amazon Prime? This information will allow users to stream, read and listen to topics even quicker.

### Create An Account

**Allowing users to create an account through the application instead of through Google.**

Allowing users to create an account through hearth. Easier way to save preferences, get notifications and make the application more tailored to the user.
